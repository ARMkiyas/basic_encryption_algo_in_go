# Cipher Suite 

**Explore various classical cipher techniques and put your cryptography skills to the test!**

This repository provides a collection of well-known cipher implementations in Go, allowing you to encrypt and decrypt messages using different methods.

## Key Features

- **Multiple Ciphers:** Supports a diverse set of ciphers, including:
    - Caesar Cipher
    - Vigenere Cipher
    - Rail Fence Cipher
    - Columnar Cipher
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Guides users through the encryption and decryption process with clear prompts and instructions.
- **Error Handling:** Gracefully handles invalid inputs and provides informative error messages.
- **Flexibility:** Accommodates both encryption and decryption operations for each cipher.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/cipher-suite
   ```
2. **Navigate to the directory:**
   ```bash
   cd cipher-suite
   ```
3. **Run the program:**
   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```

## Usage

1. Upon execution, the program will present a menu of available ciphers.
2. Select your desired cipher by entering its corresponding number.
3. Choose whether to encrypt (e) or decrypt (d) a message.
4. Provide the required input (text or cipher, depending on the operation) and the appropriate key.
5. The program will display the encrypted or decrypted output.
